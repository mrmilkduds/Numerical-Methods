% I. INTRODUCTION
%     This file was made by James Stewart for AEM 349 HW 2. It uses
%     different linear system solving methods to solve for displacements of
%     a given mass-spring problem.
% 
% 
% II. CONTENTS
%     In the folder, you should find the following files:
%         README3.m
%         hw3main.m
%         gaussPivot.m
%         gaussSeidel.m
%         thomasAlgorithm.m

% III. USE
%     Once all related files are in the MATLAB work directory, running hw3main.m
%     will prompt you to for use of preset variables or custom variables
%     to solve for mass displacements.

%     After, you will be prompted to choose the linear system solving
%     method you would like to use.

%     AEM349HW2 will display the values of the displacement vector {y} to 4
%     decimals.
%     
%     Changes to max iterations and error criterion can be made for

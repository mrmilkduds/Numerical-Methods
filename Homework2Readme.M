% I. INTRODUCTION
%     This file was made by James Stewart for AEM 349 HW 2. It uses root
%     finding methods to determine a friction factor to calculate the
%     pressure drop through a section of circular pipe. 
% 
% 
% II. CONTENTS
%     In the folder, you should find the following files:
%         README.m
%         AEM349HW2.m
%         functionhw2.m
%         Bisection.m
%         falseposition.m
%         secant.m
%         newtraph.m
% 
% III. USE
%     Once all related files are in the MATLAB work directory, running AEM349HW2.m
%     will prompt you to for use of preset variables or custom variables needed to
%     determine the friction factor.
%     After, you will be prompted to choose the root finding method to determine the
%     friction factor.
%     AEM349HW2 will display the value for both the friction factor as well as the
%     pressure drop in the pipe.
%     
%     If you'd like to change the initial guesses for Bisection.m and falseposition.m,
%     the variables can be found in AEM349HW2.m under 'Root Finding
%     Guesses'.
